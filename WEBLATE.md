# Setting up Weblate for a Galette plugin site

The whole migration of a plugin, of which this is one step, is in
[MIGRATE_PLUGINS.md](MIGRATE_PLUGINS.md).

Two kinds of component are involved: this theme's interface strings, and the page
content of each plugin site. They use different file formats and behave
differently, so they are described separately.

Settings below mirror the existing Galette components (checked against
`galette/plugin-oauth2`), so a new component sits in the project the same way the
others do.

## Prerequisites

* The Weblate **GitHub App must be installed on the repository**, and granted
  write access. Every Galette component uses `vcs: github-app` with an empty
  push URL — Weblate pushes through the app and opens pull requests, so no
  deploy key is needed. A component created before the app is installed will
  fail on its first push, not on creation.
* For a plugin site the branch is **`gh-pages`**, not the default branch. Getting
  this wrong is silent: Weblate happily translates files from `develop` that the
  site never serves.
* Every write Weblate makes to `gh-pages` triggers a Pages rebuild. That is
  wanted, but it means `push_on_commit` and `commit_pending_age` decide how often
  the site rebuilds. The Galette components use `push_on_commit: true` and
  `commit_pending_age: 24`.

## 1. The theme's interface strings

Menu labels, the maintainer sentences, the download cartouche, the footer — about
twenty strings shared by every plugin site.

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Repository | `https://github.com/galette/theme-ghpages.git` |
| Branch | `main` |
| File format | **YAML file** (API `yaml`) |
| File mask | `i18n/strings/*.yml` |
| Monolingual base language file | `i18n/strings/en.yml` |
| Template for new translations | `i18n/strings/en.yml` |
| Source language | English |
| License | GPL-3.0-only |
| Merge style | Rebase |

Ten languages already have a catalogue and will be imported as translated; the
nine others appear empty and fall back to English on the sites until filled.

**`i18n/languages.yml` is deliberately outside the mask.** It is reference data —
language codes, autonyms, text direction — not translatable content. A mask of
`i18n/*.yml` would make Weblate treat `languages` as a language code.

Same reasoning for **`_data/galette.yml` on a plugin's Pages branch**: it is
generated at each release by `galette/.github/actions/release-plugin` and holds
version numbers, so no component mask may reach it. The current masks
(`*/index.md`, `*/documentation.md`) do not, and a commit from that action on the
same branch is what Weblate will occasionally have to rebase onto — harmless, it
never touches a page.

### Keeping the generated Liquid in step

The Liquid the theme ships is generated from these YAML files, so `bin/build-i18n`
has to run once translations land. The *Execute script* add-on is not available
on hosted.weblate.org, so `.github/workflows/i18n.yml` does it instead: on a push
to `main` touching `i18n/strings/**`, `i18n/languages.yml` or `bin/build-i18n`, it
regenerates the two includes and commits them if they changed. Nothing runs for
an ordinary commit.

Two things make it safe against looping: its own commit touches only
`_includes/`, which no path filter matches, and a push authenticated with
`GITHUB_TOKEN` does not start workflows.

The CI drift check therefore **warns rather than fails**. A Weblate pull request
only ever touches `i18n/strings/*.yml`, so the includes are stale until the merge
— expected, and not something to block on. On a human pull request the same
warning is the reminder to run the script.

**If `main` is protected**, the workflow's push is refused. Either allow
`github-actions[bot]` to bypass the restriction, or give the workflow a token
that can. There is no way around it with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

### Rebuilding the sites

A site using `remote_theme` downloads this repository when Pages builds it, so it
keeps serving the previous version of the theme until Pages builds it again —
nothing triggers that on its own. `bin/rebuild-consumers`, run by
`.github/workflows/rebuild-consumers.yml`, asks for one.

The sites are **discovered, not listed**: every non-archived repository of the
organisation that has a Pages site whose `_config.yml` references
`galette/theme-ghpages`. A hand-kept list went stale twice over — the day
`plugin-fullcard` moved between organisations, and the day stripe, legalnotices
and helloasso adopted the theme on a `gh-pages-galette-theme` branch of their
own. Discovery also means a repository that does not use the theme is never
rebuilt for nothing.

The scan follows the Pages source rather than assuming it: the branch can be
anything, and a source under a subdirectory has its `_config.yml` there. The
match is on the theme slug, not a whole line, so pinning to a tag
(`galette/theme-ghpages@v1`) still counts.

```bash
DRY_RUN=1 ./bin/rebuild-consumers      # list the sites without rebuilding
THEME_ORG=… THEME_SLUG=… EXTRA_REPOS=… # scan elsewhere, or add repos outside the org
```

The workflow exposes the same dry run through *Run workflow*.

It runs when `_layouts/`, `_includes/`, `_sass/` or `assets/` change on `main`,
and also after *Regenerate i18n* completes. That second trigger is not
redundant: the regeneration commits `_includes/` with `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and such a
push starts no workflow, so a translation update would otherwise never reach the
sites.

**It needs a token, and this is why.** `GITHUB_TOKEN` is minted for the workflow's
own repository and cannot act on another one, whatever permissions the workflow
declares — so it can never rebuild a plugin site. The workflow reads
`secrets.CONSUMER_PAGES_TOKEN` instead, which needs the **Pages** repository
permission at *write* on the consuming repositories. An organisation secret
shared with this repository covers them all at once. A fine-grained token limited
to Pages is enough; it needs no code access.

Without the secret the workflow does not fail, it warns and rebuilds nothing —
so a fork or a contributor is not blocked. When a rebuild is refused it does
fail, because a site silently serving a stale theme is the thing this exists to
prevent.

## 2. A plugin site's pages

One component per page, because a component maps one file mask. Rather than
creating them by hand, create one and let the **Component discovery** add-on
create the rest — it also picks up a page added later.

### Create the first component

*Add new translation component*, **From version control**:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Component name | `Fullcard site: documentation` |
| Repository | `https://github.com/galette-plugins/plugin-fullcard.git` |
| **Branch** | **`gh-pages`** — not the default branch |
| File format | **Markdown file** |
| File mask | `*/documentation.md` |
| Monolingual base language file | `documentation.md` |
| Template for new translations | `documentation.md` |
| Source language | English |
| License | `CC-BY-SA-4.0` — the pages, unlike the theme, see `LICENSE.contents` |

**In the creation form, before saving**, under **File format parameters** — not
afterwards. Until *Translate front matter values* is on, the front matter is not
a translatable unit, so Weblate's first write copies the source one over every
language file and destroys every translated `title`. Enabling it later re-reads
files that are English by then and records English as the translation, so the
loss is silent. fullcard lost eight titles exactly this way.

* **Translate front matter values** — on. The pages carry `title` and
  `description` in their front matter, and the tagline in the header comes from
  `description`. Without this the front matter is offered as one opaque block.
* **Deduplicate identical strings** — on. It keeps translations stable when a
  table row or a section moves.

### Add the discovery add-on

*Manage → Add-ons → Component discovery* (`weblate.discovery.discovery`):

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Regular expression | see below |
| File format | Markdown file |
| Customize the component name | `Fullcard site: {{ component }}` |
| Define the monolingual base filename | `{{ component }}.md` |
| Define the base file for new translations | `{{ component }}.md` |
| Clone add-ons from the main component | on |
| Remove components for inexistent files | off, at least to start with |

```
(?P<language>[a-z]{2,3}(?:_[A-Z]{2})?)/(?P<component>[^/]+)\.md
```

Both groups are open by shape, not by list: a page added later is picked up, and
so is a language, which is the point — languages arrive on a translator's request,
not on a release. The same expression fits every Galette plugin site.

Weblate derives the file mask by replacing the language group with `*`, giving
`*/index.md` and `*/documentation.md` — and `*/installation.md` the day such a
page appears. The add-on runs on installation and after every repository update.

`en` never matches: the English pages are the base files, at the root.

**The add-on discovers files, so it needs at least one language directory to
exist.** A site published in English only — which is how a plugin now starts,
since nothing hand-translated should be committed — gives it nothing to match,
and no component is ever created. Create one component per page by hand instead;
auto has two, `documentation` and `index`. Add the add-on later, when a third
page or the first language directory exists, and it will pick the rest up.

**The one thing to watch**: a *two or three letter* directory holding a `.md`
would be taken for a language — `doc/`, `img/`, `api/`, `css/` all fit the shape.
`images/`, where the screenshots go, is too long to match, and that is the only
such directory these sites have. If you ever add a short one, exclude it with a
negative lookahead: `(?P<language>(?!doc|img)[a-z]{2,3}…`.

**File format parameters are not part of the add-on's configuration.** Cloning
add-ons does not clone them, so check *Translate front matter values* and
*Deduplicate identical strings* on each component the add-on creates.

File format parameters, both components:

* **Translate front matter values** — on. The pages carry `title` and
  `description` in their front matter, and the tagline in the header comes from
  `description`. Without this the front matter is offered as one opaque block.
* **Deduplicate identical strings** (`markdown_merge_duplicates`) — on. It keeps
  translations stable when a table row or a section moves.

**Do not put the theme's admonitions in a page Weblate writes.** Measured on
maps, twice:

* `{% include alert.html type="warning" content="…" %}` — the include this cost
  us, and which no longer exists — becomes one unit carrying the whole Liquid
  tag. Weblate re-wraps the file at `line_max_length`, an
  include tag has to hold a single line, and the Pages build then fails on
  **every** language file — the untranslated ones too, since the English source
  is re-wrapped as well. French had also closed `content="` with a guillemet.
* A blockquote with a kramdown attribute list — `{: .admonition
  .admonition-warning}` — produces the include's own markup from plain Markdown,
  but Weblate's serialiser folds the attribute list into the paragraph text: the
  classes stop applying and the braces show as content. It fails softly rather
  than breaking the build, but it fails.

What survives is a quoted paragraph opening with a bold label:

```markdown
> **Warning** — Check the usage policy of the provider you choose.
```

The theme styles blockquotes already, the label travels inside the sentence so it
gets translated (the include hardcoded it, capitalised), and no round-trip can
break it. Keep the admonition include for pages no translator touches.

`line_max_length: 80` is not the culprit and is worth keeping: it reflows the
Markdown so a one-word change touches one line in the diff instead of a whole
paragraph. It only ever hurts content that is not prose.

There is deliberately **no identifier in the front matter**: the theme derives the
language from the directory and pairs a page with its translations by file name,
so `title` and `description` are the only keys, and both are meant to be
translated. Nothing here has to be marked read-only.

### The one trap that matters

The Markdown format is **monolingual, and Weblate does not read translations back
from the repository**. The documentation is explicit:

> Unlike most other formats, the changes in the translation files will not be
> imported to Weblate because it can not be done reliably. The source of truth
> for the translations is Weblate not the translated file.

So a translated `de/documentation.md` sitting in the branch counts for nothing:
Weblate will consider German untranslated and, on its first write, replace the
file with its own output. For `plugin-fullcard` that would discard the nine
catalogues recovered from the Sphinx manual.

The order this forces, when component discovery creates the components:

1. **Create the discovery component.** It finds `*/index.md` and
   `*/documentation.md` and creates one component per page — you do not create
   them by hand, so there is no "upload first" option.
2. **Expect Weblate to flatten the translated files.** Considering those
   languages untranslated, its first write replaces each `<lang>/*.md` with its
   own output, most likely through a pull request. This is not a loss: the
   content stays in the branch history, so
   `git show <commit>:de/documentation.md` gets any of them back.
3. **Upload the translations, one file per language per component.** In each
   component, per language, *Files → Upload translation*. An explicit upload goes
   through the parser and does populate Weblate, unlike a repository change.
4. **Weblate then opens a pull request** re-adding the files it now considers
   translated.

### Let the component settle before writing to it

Creating or updating a component starts a chain of background jobs, and Weblate
**locks the component** while they run. Anything else is refused with `423
Locked` — adding a language included, which is how three of maps' eleven
silently failed to be created. Wait for the lock instead of retrying:

```sh
curl -s -H @hdr https://hosted.weblate.org/api/components/galette/<slug>/lock/
```

A linked component has its own lock, so check both. The English units appear only
once that first scan is done: until then the component reports zero strings and
looks broken. A `POST /repository/` with `{"operation": "pull"}` brings the scan
forward once the lock is clear.

**That check is advisory, not a reservation.** Weblate can take the lock between
the moment it answers `false` and the moment the next request arrives — two of
eleven languages came back `423` on events despite waiting for each one. So
retry the request itself, treating `423` as "wait and try again" and `400` as
"already there", rather than trusting the lock endpoint and moving on. A request
lost that way leaves no trace in the interface: the language is simply absent.

### A Weblate pull request that cannot be merged

Symptom: its previous pull request was merged, the next one shows a conflict or
refuses to merge, and Weblate itself reports nothing pending on either component.

Cause: these repositories do not allow merge commits, so a Weblate pull request
is squashed. Its original commits are then no longer ancestors of the branch, and
if Weblate opens the next request before pulling that squashed tip, it re-proposes
what is already there. GitHub can still report it `mergeable`, while
`rebaseable` is false — which is what disables the button when rebase is the only
method left.

Check before touching anything, because the answer decides everything: compare
each file in the request against the branch. If every blob matches, the request
carries nothing.

```sh
for f in $(gh pr view <n> --repo <repo> --json files --jq '.files[].path'); do
  a=$(gh api "repos/<repo>/contents/$f?ref=<pr head sha>" --jq .sha)
  b=$(gh api "repos/<repo>/contents/$f?ref=gh-pages"      --jq .sha)
  [ "$a" = "$b" ] || echo "differs: $f"
done
```

Then close it and reset the component's working copy — the translations live in
Weblate's database, so a reset discards only the diverged git branch:

```sh
curl -X POST -H @hdr -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"operation": "reset"}' \
  https://hosted.weblate.org/api/components/galette/<parent slug>/repository/
```

Afterwards `weblate_commit` and `remote_commit` read the same revision, and the
next request is built from the current tip. This is not worth a policy change:
maps merged five Weblate requests in a row without trouble, so the divergence
usually resolves itself on the next pull.

### Recovering the old catalogues, without recording English

The Sphinx `.po` files hold the translations the manual accumulated. Two ways in,
and they are not equivalent.

**The translation memory, which is the one to use.** One multilingual TMX per
plugin, imported in *Manage → Translation memory → Import*, then *Tools →
Automatic translation* on each component with **Translation memory** as the
source and a **100 %** threshold. It writes only the units it actually matches,
so a unit the catalogue never covered simply stays untranslated — visibly, in the
progress bar. The import form asks for no language: `import_tmx` reads `srclang`
from the header and every `<tuv xml:lang>` of each unit, and its two selectors
are enforced only for `.xliff`, `.po` and `.csv`. One unknown code aborts the
whole import, it is not skipped.

**Build the memory against the units Weblate parsed, not against the file.** Two
differences make a source that looks identical fail to match:

* the Markdown parser replaces every link target with a positional placeholder,
  so `[Club 404](https://…)` is `[Club 404]{1}` in the unit — a memory carrying
  the URL matches nothing at 100 %, and the same conversion has to be applied to
  the translations or Weblate writes a broken link;
* the front matter `title` is a unit of its own that no documentation catalogue
  ever held. It is in the theme's own strings, as `t_nav_doc`.

So close the loop before importing: read the English units back and count the
sources that match exactly.

```sh
curl -s -H @hdr '…/api/translations/galette/<component>/en/units/?page_size=100'
```

On auto that took the memory from 18 of 24 units to 21. The three left are the
page description and the two download bullets, which have no old translation at
all — and that is visible rather than guessed.

**But first, know what "add new translation" does.** It copies the base file, so
every unit of the new language immediately holds the **English source as its
translation**, and the `same_edit` add-on then flags them as needing edit. Two
consequences, both of which cost a detour on auto:

* *Automatic translation* filtered on `state:empty` matches nothing — no unit is
  empty. The API answers `no strings were updated` and looks like a memory
  problem when it is not.
* A script that skips units with a non-empty target skips every single one.

This is also the mechanism behind trap 8: the English copy is what a first write
pushes back to the repository, and what a later read records as the translation.

**Writing the units directly, which is what worked.** With the catalogues already
converted, `PATCH /api/units/{id}/` with `{"target": ["…"], "state": 20}` puts
each translation where it belongs, and the condition to test is **whether the
current target equals the source**, not whether it is empty. Units with no
translation at all get `{"target": [""], "state": 0}` — untranslated is the
truthful state, and it is what makes the gap visible.

On auto: 21 of 24 units for seven languages, 19 for German, in about four
minutes of API calls. Words that are identical in both languages —
`Documentation`, `Installation` — stay flagged as needing edit, which is exactly
what that add-on is for.

**A prepared `<lang>/page.md`, only as a fallback.** A monolingual Markdown
upload maps units by the file's structure, so every block has to be there,
including the ones the catalogue never translated — and those carry the English
source. Uploading such a file records English as that language's translation for
each of them: trap 9 again, in miniature. Measured on auto: the best languages
still carry two English units out of twenty-two, German five.

So the order is: import the TMX, create the components, add the languages, run
automatic translation, and only then consider uploading anything. If you do
upload, clear what came in identical afterwards — filter the component on
`check:same` and bulk-edit, which is also how the fullcard leftovers get cleaned.

**Keep `doc-plugins-fullcard` until step 3 is done.** Its strings feed the project
translation memory, so a translator is offered the old wording as a full match
instead of retyping it — and it is the safety net if an upload goes wrong.

Also worth knowing: Weblate labels this format's support as *under development*,
with behaviour that may change between releases. Worth a check after a Weblate
upgrade.

## 3. Adding a language

Nothing to do in the theme: all nineteen languages Galette translates into are
already declared in `i18n/languages.yml`, and a language with no catalogue simply
renders the English strings while keeping its own `lang` attribute and text
direction.

On the plugin site, add its `defaults` entry in `_config.yml` — `plugin-fullcard`
already lists all nineteen — and Weblate can then create the page files itself.
